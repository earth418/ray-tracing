# ray-tracing

I've been making a ray-tracer! Using a combination of my own intution of ray-tracing...

...and a _lot_ of help from this wonderful book: https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/

I added Quaternions & rotation to mine, which actually worked super well like first try, which was wild. And it can output to video! Which I think is super cool.

I'll probably keep chipping away at it, maybe try to make it render triangles and import 3D models.
